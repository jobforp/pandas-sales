============

exploration of python pandas and a sales spreadsheet


##Goal

Most pandas examples are for scientific or numerical calculations. This is a quick exploration/tutorial of using pandas for business reporting. In this case I have used a sales spreadsheet. In the future I will probably do some munging of the chinook sqlite database <http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/>.


I feel that pandas in combination with sql and a bit of excel and dc.js has the potential to replace expensive tools such as Business Objects and Tableau.

If you are running windows/mac I highly recommend the anaconda distribution located  here <http://continuum.io/downloads> to get started.  As well there are several other good tutorials on the web that are not from a business perspect
